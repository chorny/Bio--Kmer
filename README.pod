Kmer

=head1 SYNOPSIS

A module for helping with kmer analysis.

  use strict;
  use warnings;
  use Bio::Kmer;
  
  my $kmer=Bio::Kmer->new("file.fastq.gz",{kmercounter=>"jellyfish",numcpus=>4});
  my $kmerHash=$kmer->kmers();
  my $countOfCounts=$kmer->histogram();

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A module for helping with kmer analysis. The basic methods help count kmers and can produce a count of counts.  Currently this module only supports fastq format.  Although this module can count kmers with pure perl, it is recommended to give the option for a different kmer counter such as Jellyfish.

=over

=item new

Create a new instance of the kmer counter.  One object per file. 

  Applicable arguments:
  Argument     Default    Description
  kmercounter  perl       What kmer counter software to use.
                          Choices: Perl, Jellyfish.
  kmerlength   21         Kmer length
  numcpus      1          This module uses perl 
                          multithreading with pure perl or 
                          can supply this option to other 
                          software like jellyfish.
  gt           1          If the count of kmers is fewer 
                          than this, ignore the kmer. This 
                          might help speed analysis if you 
                          do not care about low-count kmers.

  Examples:
  my $kmer=Bio::Kmer->new("file.fastq.gz",{kmercounter=>"jellyfish",numcpus=>4});

=over

=item query

Query the set of kmers with your own query

  Arguments: query (string)
  Returns:   Count of kmers. 
              0 indicates that the kmer was not found.
             -1 indicates an invalid kmer (e.g., invalid length)

=over

=item histogram

Count the frequency of kmers.

  Arguments: none
  Returns:   Reference to an array of counts. The index of 
             the array is the frequency.
