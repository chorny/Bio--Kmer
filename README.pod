[1mSYNOPSIS[0m
       A module for helping with kmer analysis.

         use strict;
         use warnings;
         use Bio::Kmer;

         my $kmer=Bio::Kmer->new("file.fastq.gz",{kmercounter=>"jellyfish",numcpus=>4});
         my $kmerHash=$kmer->kmers();
         my $countOfCounts=$kmer->histogram();

[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
       A module for helping with kmer analysis. The basic methods help count
       kmers and can produce a count of counts.  Currently this module only
       supports fastq format.  Although this module can count kmers with pure
       perl, it is recommended to give the option for a different kmer counter
       such as Jellyfish.

[1mMETHODS[0m
       Bio::Kmer->new($filename, \%options)
           Create a new instance of the kmer counter.  One object per file.

             Applicable arguments:
             Argument     Default    Description
             kmercounter  perl       What kmer counter software to use.
                                     Choices: Perl, Jellyfish.
             kmerlength   21         Kmer length
             numcpus      1          This module uses perl
                                     multithreading with pure perl or
                                     can supply this option to other
                                     software like jellyfish.
             gt           1          If the count of kmers is fewer
                                     than this, ignore the kmer. This
                                     might help speed analysis if you
                                     do not care about low-count kmers.

             Examples:
             my $kmer=Bio::Kmer->new("file.fastq.gz",{kmercounter=>"jellyfish",numcpus=>4});

       $kmer->query($queryString)
           Query the set of kmers with your own query

             Arguments: query (string)
             Returns:   Count of kmers.
                         0 indicates that the kmer was not found.
                        -1 indicates an invalid kmer (e.g., invalid length)

       $kmer->[4mhistogram()[0m
           Count the frequency of kmers.

             Arguments: none
             Returns:   Reference to an array of counts. The index of
                        the array is the frequency.

       $kmer->union($kmer2)
           Count the frequency of kmers.

             Arguments: Another Bio::Kmer object
             Returns:   List of kmers

       $kmer->union($kmer2)
           Count the frequency of kmers.

             Arguments: Another Bio::Kmer object
             Returns:   List of kmers
